# Power BI Dashboard - People Attendance and Trends

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that tracks the attendance of people and analyzes how it varies over time, including trends related to work from home and sick leave. The dashboard provides valuable insights into employee attendance patterns and helps in understanding workforce trends.

## Dashboard Features

The Power BI dashboard offers the following features and visualizations:

2. **Attendance by Time**: Displays a line chart showcasing attendance patterns throughout the day. This helps identify peak attendance hours and any significant variations.

3. **Work from Home Analysis**: Analyzes the frequency and duration of work from home arrangements. This visualization helps assess the impact of remote work on attendance and productivity.

4. **Sick Leave Trends**: Tracks sick leave instances over time and identifies any recurring patterns or spikes. This information aids in understanding the frequency and impact of sick leave on attendance.
